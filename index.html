    What is the days payable outstanding?<br>
    The days payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that measures the average number of days that the firm takes in order to pay it's bills to the vendors, financiers and suppliers.<br>
    How to calculate days payable outstanding?<br>
    To calculate days payable outstanding you should use the following formula:<br>
    days payable outstanding = (accounts payable * number of days) / cost of goods sold<br>
    Example: In 2020 company x had accounts payable worth of $7,300,000 and it also had $66,100,000 in cost of goods sold (COGS), calculate the days payable outstanding for company x in the year 2020?<br>
    Using the days payable outstanding formula the answer will be:<br>
    days payable outstanding = (accounts payable * number of days) / cost of goods sold<br>
    days payable outstanding = ($7,300,000 * 365) / $66,100,000<br>
    days payable outstanding = 40.3 days<br>
    Why use days payable outstanding?<br>
    Companies use days payable outstanding in order to track and manage their cash flow. High days payable outstanding is more likable because it means that the firm has more cash to fund operations.<br>
